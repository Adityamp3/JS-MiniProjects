# JS Mini Projects

Welcome to the JS Mini Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of small JavaScript projects designed to help you practice and improve your coding skills.

## Projects

1. **Cursor Stocker** : A simple object that follows the mouse everywhere having an ease and delay.
2. **Mousemove Girgit** : A rectangular div which changes color gradually from red to blue as the mouse move from one end to another.
3. **Pop-Pics** : A cool way of popping pictures on mouse move by making an array of images.
4. **To-Do List App** : A To-Do list application where you can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

Feel free to explore each project folder for more details and implementation!
